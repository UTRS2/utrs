# UTRS 2.0

## Getting UTRS2 working in a dev environment

1. Clone into a directory
2. composer install
3. cp .env.example .env
4. edit the DB details in .env
5. php artisan key:generate
6. php artisan migrate:fresh

The /public subdirectory is the webroot. You can either use `php artisan serve` to run a standalone webserver, or point your webserver of choice at /public

## Building frontend assets

The frontend is built using Bootstrap 4. It uses `purgecss` to remove unused classes to reduce bundle size. This can create complications for development thru.

First, install NPM dependencies using `npm install`. Then, you can use Laravel Mix (webpack wrapper) to build assets:

* Use `npm run watch` to start Webpack mix in development watch mode. That mode does not use PurgeCSS and it re-builds
  all assets when it detects a change. This is most useful when working with JavaScript or when modifying the SCSS files.
* Use `npm run dev` to do one build in the development mode. This mode does not use PurgeCSS. This is most useful when
  you are working on the frontend, as you have access to all classes Bootstrap has to offer.
* Use `npm run prod` to do a production build. This build uses PurgeCSS and URL versioning. Due to legacy reasons a
  production build should be commited to the repository for pull requests. This may change soon, see issue
  [#240](https://github.com/UTRS2/utrs/issues/240).

## Setting up MediaWiki integration (for testing)

### API calls

You have a couple of options here. Either

#### Create a bot password for your own testing MediaWiki installation
Use `Special:BotPasswords` to create a bot password. If you have configured e-mail sending to mediawiki, access to that is useful.

In `.env`, set `MEDIAWIKI_USERNAME` to the bot password username and `MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD` to the password.
Also set `WIKI_URL_GLOBAL`, `WIKI_URL_ENWIKI`, and `WIKI_URL_PTWIKI` to be `http://your-mediawiki/w/api.php`. 

#### Create a bot password on [Beta Cluster](https://beta.wmflabs.org)
This is useful because Beta Cluster is really similar to beta. Use `Special:BotPasswords` on some wiki to create a bot password (they are global).

In `.env`, set `MEDIAWIKI_USERNAME` to the bot password username and `MEDIAWIKI_PASSWORD` to the password.
Also set
* `WIKI_URL_GLOBAL=https://meta.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/w/api.php`
* `WIKI_URL_ENWIKI=https://en.wikipedia.beta.wmflabs.org/w/api.php`
* `WIKI_URL_PTWIKI=https://es.wikipedia.beta.wmflabs.org/w/api.php # no ptwiki on betacluster, let's use eswiki instead`

### OAuth
You need a wiki with `Extension:OAuth` installed. It's easier if you use the same wiki used with API calls.

Use the following settings:
* Protocol version: 1.0a
* Callback URL: `http://utrs.test/oauth/callback` change this depending on your setup
* "Allow consumer to specify a callback in requests and use "callback" URL above as a required prefix." should be yes
* Types of grants being requested: "User identity verification only"

If you set it as for yourself only you don't need to get it approved.

Set up `.env`:

```dotenv
OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL="http://utrs.test/oauth/callback" # change this also depending on your setup

OAUTH_BASE_URL="https://meta.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org"
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="some-client-id"
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="some-client-secret"
```

## Jobs
For this to work, you need to have your own urls set up for config/wikis.php<br/>
This application requires a job queue to verify blocks and do other critical and regualar tasks. Below is a guide to setting up:

1. pecl install redis
2. Ensure jobs work with php artisan queue:work
3. sudo adduser supervisor
4. sudo apt-get install supervisor
5. Add the following block at /etc/supervisor/conf.d/utrs.conf, example, replacing /path/tos:

DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THESE VALUES EXCEPT THE PATHS

```
[program:utrs-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /path/to/artisan queue:work --sleep=3 --tries=3
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=supervisor
numprocs=1
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/path/to/log/file.log
stopwaitsecs=300
```

6. sudo supervisord
